# Infix-Evaluator
The program reads infix expressions from a file, evaluates them, and outputs the results to another file. Each expression involves only addition and multiplication operations with single-digit integers. The program uses a recursive approach to parse and evaluate these expressions based on the provided Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar.
